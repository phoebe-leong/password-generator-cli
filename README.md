## Usage

Arguments will be implemented later. For now this software uses input so just start it and go through the steps

## Building

### Linux

To build this project, just run `make`. The binary will be generated in bin/

### Windows

**Recommended:** use WSL or Git Bash

If you don't want to, try to build it on Windows directly but I will not be able to help you a lot with it
